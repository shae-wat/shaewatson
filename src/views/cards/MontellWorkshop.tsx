          During the lockdown of the pandemic, new opportunities to connect with
          others online popped up, including zoom workshops. I took Amanda
          Montellâ€™s writing workshop in early 2021, after her publication of
          Wordslut and before Cultish was released.

          The group worked through writing prompts together and learned about
          writing nonfiction in an engaging way, inspired by Amanda and other
          writers like Mary Roach.

          The workshop ended with attendees submitting a writing sample that was
          reviewed by other attendees and Amanda as how she was working with
          editors to publish her own nonfiction work.
