          After SoFi acquired Clara Lending in early 2018, my team transitioned
          to working on SoFi‚Äôs new personal finance app. As a daily Mint user at
          the time, it was super exciting for me to be part of the early product
          design thinking of SoFi Relay.

          Since it was a greenfield project, I led the team to establish values
          that would guide the architectural and code stylings of the front-end.
        </ParagraphFont>
        <ParagraphFont>
          For example, one value of the project is ‚Äúthe front-end web is a thin
          layer on top of the backend API.‚Äù This shared value drove many
          decisions and grounded many conversations during the initialization of
          the codebase, where the code written during that time has led to
          repeating patterns deeply embedded in the project.
