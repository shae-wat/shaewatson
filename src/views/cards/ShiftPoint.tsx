          After 10 years focusing on my technical software development, I took
          time out of the traditional workforce. May things led to thisâ€” I
          provided care-taking and spent final days with my terminally ill
          father as the COVID-19 pandemic challenged the fabric of our society.

          The illusion of Silicon Valley reached new peaks in the stock market
          and my employer SoFi IPO'ed in the context of economic abandonment and
          mass death.

        <ParagraphFont>
          I decided to buy myself time to care for the people sharing this world
          and life with me and to re-align myself with my newfound deeper
          understanding of the world and economic forces.

          My father did not survive to retirement age, so I am glad I took this
          time in my own life because a peaceful retirement and time off at the
          end of one's life is not guaranteed.
