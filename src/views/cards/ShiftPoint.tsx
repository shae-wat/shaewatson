          After 10 years focusing on my technical software development, I took
          time out of the traditional workforce. Many things led to thisâ€” I
          provided care-taking and spent final days with my terminally ill
          father as the COVID-19 pandemic challenged the fabric of our society.

          The illusion of Silicon Valley reached new peaks in the stock market
          and my employer SoFi IPO'ed in the context of economic abandonment and
          mass death.

        <ParagraphFont>
          I decided to buy myself time to care for the people sharing this one
          world and one life with me. The time allowed me to align myself with
          my newfound deeper understanding of the world and economic forces, to
          heal and process and grow.

          My father did not survive to retirement age, so I am glad I took this
          time in my own life because a peaceful retirement and time off at the
          end of one's life is not guaranteed.
