          I am proud to have developed the early efforts of the Small Business
          Forward San Francisco advocacy group starting in August 2023 when I
          posted the group's first Instagram story and launched the website
          working as the group's coordinator.

          Working with the small business founders to define and illustrate the
          organizing values that the group would base its advocacy on, I guided
          the group through getting legally defined as a Non-Profit 501(c)(4),
          running education sessions, and handling membership outreach to
          increase turnout to events and awareness of the group and advocacy.

          Writing the newsletter allowed me to synthesize all the conversations
          I was having with different small businesses and announce the group's
          advocacy achievements and efforts, of which there were many.

          Coordinating the team through the launch of Small Business Forward
          allowed my experience in technical startups to shine through as I was
          able to establish all the platforms the group needed and get them set
          up on those platforms for maximum efficiency with minimal upkeep
          needed.
