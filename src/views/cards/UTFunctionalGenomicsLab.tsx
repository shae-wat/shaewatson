          After micropipetting for a few months, I was drawn to visualizing the
          data of the lab in order to parse meaning from the gigabytes of
          numbers produced by next generation sequencing technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The software I wrote drew presentable images of computationed results,
          removing noise and allowing researchers to see the results of their
          work in an intuitive way where patterns could be recognized.
