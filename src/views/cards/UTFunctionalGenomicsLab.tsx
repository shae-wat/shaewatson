          After micropipetting for a few months, I was drawn to visualizing the
          data of the lab in order to parse meaning from the gigabytes of data
          produced by next generation sequencing technology.

          The software I wrote drew presentable images of the genetic sequencing
          results, removing noise and allowing researchers to see the results of
          their work in an intuitive way where patterns could be recognized.
